  summary:
    "Every electrode reaction happens in a region only a few atoms thick, " +
    "where the extra charge on the metal meets a cloud of ions that " +
    "balances it. This lesson builds that region step by step: first the " +
    "Helmholtz sheet, then the Gouy-Chapman cloud, then the Stern " +
    "compromise, and finally the thermodynamics that needs no model at " +
    "all. Along the way you meet the Debye length, the point of zero " +
    "charge, electrocapillary curves, adsorption isotherms, and the " +
    "difference between charging an interface and using up a reactant.",
