// Content model for the site.
//
// Everything the site displays is hard-coded in `content/`. There is no
// database and no fetch at runtime. Adding material means adding a file and
// one line to content/index.ts - see ADDING_A_LESSON.md.
//
// The nesting is:
//
//   Subject   -> a subject area, e.g. "Physical Chemistry"
//     Course  -> a group of lessons, e.g. "Electrochemistry"
//       Lesson -> e.g. "Lesson 1", has its own question bank
//         Section -> one routable page, e.g. "/lessons/lesson-1/nernst"
//
// Sections are the unit you actually study: each is its own short page with
// its own Next / Previous buttons and its own quick check, so no single page
// ever gets long.
